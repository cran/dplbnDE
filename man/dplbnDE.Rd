\title{Discriminative Parameter Learning of Bayesian Networks by Differential Evolution}
\description{
Implements Differential Evolution (DE) to train parameters of Bayesian Networks
(BN) for optimizing the Conditional Log-Likelihood (Discriminative Learning)
instead of the log-likelihood (Generative Learning). Any given BN structure
encodes assumptions about conditional independencies among the attributes and
will result  in error if they do not hold in the data. Such an error includes
the classification dimension. The main goal of Discriminative learning is minimize
this type of error.

DE variants:
Based on different strategies followed by the operators of DE, there are
different variants, which define the way in which the mutant and trial
vectors are generated. The most popular variant is called \code{DE/rand/1/bin}, where ``DE''
means Differential Evolution, the word ``rand'' indicates that the so-called base vector
is randomly chosen, ``1'' is the number of vector pairs (i.e., vector differences to be
calculated) chosen, and finally ``bin'' means that a binomial recombination is chosen.
The following is a list with the available variants:

\itemize{
\item \code{\link{DErand}}: Implements \code{DE/rand/} variant with 1 or 2 pairs
of vector differences, and binomial or exponential recombination. (Price and Storn, 1996)
\item \code{\link{DEbest}}: Implements \code{DE/best/} variant with 1 or 2 pairs
of vector differences and binomial or exponential recombination. (Price and Storn, 1996)
\item \code{\link{jade}}: A variant that includes some mechanisms to decrease the
dependence to its parameter values such as F and CR. JADE uses a mutation strategy
called \code{DE/current-to-pbest}, where \eqn{p \in (0 , 1]}. Base vectors are selected
from the best \eqn{100p}% vectors in the current population. JADE, with the aim to
maintaining diversity, uses an optional external archive. (Zhang and Sanderson, 2009)
\item \code{\link{lshade}}: An improved version of JADE, LSHADE incorporates a
Linear Population Size Reduction (LPSR) in order to improve the performance. (Tanabe and Fukunaga, 2014)
